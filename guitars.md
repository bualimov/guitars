# How to tune an acoustic guitar!
The guitar is a beautiful instrument and is one of the most widely recognizable and played instruments around the world.
Popular variants include the acoustic, the classical (Spanish), electric guitar, and the bass guitar. If you own an acoustic, you can follow each step exactly as it is. If you have any of the other three, the process for tuning is slightly different. Other than that, let's go!

## What you'll need:
- Acoustic guitar
- Your phone

## Steps:
1. On your phone, download the _GuitarTuna_ app
    - On a six-string guitar, the six string are as follows (from top to bottom):
        1. low E string (E2)
        2. A
        3. D
        4. G
        5. B
        6. high E string (E4) <br/>

**Note**: Tuning pegs are locaated at the end of the guitar - they look like pegs. <br/>
    You will turn these clockwise/counterclockwise, depending on note sound. <br/>

2. Starting from the top down, strum each string individually.
    - The app will indicate if the pitch is too high, too low, or just right.
3. If working with the *first three strings* (low E, A, and D):
    - If the note is too *high*:
        - Turn the knob towards you (clockwise)
    - If the note is too *low*:
        - Turn the knob away from you (counter-clockwise) <br/>
4. Repeat step 3 for *first three strings*.

**Note**: You will see why the row is important soon. <br/>

5. Otherwise, if working with the *last three strings* (G, B, high E):
    - If the note is too *high*:
        - Turn the knob away from you (counter-clockwise) <br/>
    - If the note is too *low*:
        - Turn the knob towards you (clockwise)
6. Repeat step 5 on the *last three strings*.
7. You are all done! Tuning on top row is different from bottom row.
    - They are inversed from each other
    - For example: twisting knob away from you on top row will **raise the pitch**
        - and doing the same on the bottom row will **lower the pitch**
8. Enjoy playing your guitar! Experiment with some new songs!
